TSLA,"Tesla must do these 3 on its earnings call, or else","You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. With all due respect to JPMorgan (JPM) and Netflix (NFLX), the most important earnings report of the early earnings season will come on Tuesday by way of embattled Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker’s stock has been run over since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. It’s not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The public’s rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales. Meanwhile, Trump’s 145% tariffs on China risk Tesla getting the parts it needs to profitably grow a business like the Cybercab while also operating successfully in the country. “The turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,” tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock:  Government exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla. Tariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trump’s tariffs on Tesla’s business. Turning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. The company may not be bloated cost-wise like typical turnarounds, but Musk has a lot to fix to get the top line back on track.

He then returned to Intel several years ago to revive the chip giant. But Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel was rocky as the company fell behind rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with AI chips. The company also made a big decision to start making its own chips, which came at a material cost to the bottom line. With results and the stock price under pressure, Gelsinger and Intel parted ways in December 2024. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Gelsinger now that he has had some time to reflect on his Intel tenure. Gelsinger has emerged as an investor in startups, taking his experience at Intel and seeking to help the next generation of tech leaders.

There isn’t much Pat Gelsinger hasn’t done in the tech industry. He created cutting-edge technology decades ago at Intel (INTC). Then went off to VMware to reinvent the tech player. He then returned to Intel several years ago to revive the chip giant. But Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel was rocky as the company fell behind rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with AI chips. The company also made a big decision to start making its own chips, which came at a material cost to the bottom line. With results and the stock price under pressure, Gelsinger and Intel parted ways in December 2024. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Gelsinger now that he has had some time to reflect on his Intel tenure. Gelsinger has emerged as an investor in startups, taking his experience at Intel and seeking to help the next generation of tech leaders.
